welcome to the last steps of development for this project from now on this will be a sort of kanban board since i prefer to keep it local instead of creating it on github for personal use.

goals to finish for mvp:

addStyle 
    inventory:false,
    addCar:false, 
    dashboard:false,
    aboutUs: false, 
    home: false

addFunctionality

    in the dashboard there will be three options update/delete/add cars, see messages from users filling out input fields.✔️

    when deleting a car i will be able to also delete the files in my r2 bucket as i can in the mongo dashboard



smallAdditions(things i would like to polish)

    fix searchFilter to not allow empty strings in the select options
